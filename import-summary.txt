ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

                  -                     

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Doxyfile
* LICENSE-2.0.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => andBase\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\android-support-v13.jar => andBase\libs\android-support-v13.jar
* libs\ksoap2-android-assembly-3.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar => andBase\libs\ksoap2-android-assembly-3.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* proguard-project.txt => andBase\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => andBase\src\main\res\
* src\ => andBase\src\main\java\
* src\com\ab\util\image\arrow.png => andBase\src\main\resources\com\ab\util\image\arrow.png
* src\com\ab\util\image\crop_big.png => andBase\src\main\resources\com\ab\util\image\crop_big.png
* src\com\ab\util\image\crop_small.png => andBase\src\main\resources\com\ab\util\image\crop_small.png
* src\com\ab\view\chart\package.html => andBase\src\main\resources\com\ab\view\chart\package.html
* src\com\ab\view\slidingmenu\package.html => andBase\src\main\resources\com\ab\view\slidingmenu\package.html

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
